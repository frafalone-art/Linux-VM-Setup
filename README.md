# 🐧 linux-vm-setup

Shell scripts I use to provision my own **Ubuntu VMs** for hosting **FastAPI** services — from a bare install to a hardened, production-ready server running behind nginx and Supervisor.

I built these to standardize how I set up every new VM (mainly on Oracle Cloud), instead of repeating the same manual steps each time. Sharing them here in case they're useful to someone else too. 🚀

## 📦 What's inside

Each script does **one job** and can be run on its own, or all together via `setup-all.sh`.

| # | Script | What it does |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1️⃣ | `01-system-update.sh` | Updates & upgrades all system packages, cleans up unused ones |
| 2️⃣ | `02-create-user.sh` | Creates a non-root sudo user and copies your SSH key to it |
| 3️⃣ | `03-setup-swap.sh` | Creates a swap file (handy on low-RAM VMs, e.g. free-tier instances) |
| 4️⃣ | `04-setup-venv.sh` | Creates the app folder, a Python virtual environment, and installs `requirements.txt` |
| 5️⃣ | `05-setup-supervisor.sh` | Configures Supervisor to run your FastAPI app (via `uvicorn`) as a background service |
| 6️⃣ | `06-setup-nginx.sh` | Sets up nginx as a reverse proxy in front of your app |
| 7️⃣ | `07-setup-firewall.sh` | Installs UFW and opens only ports **22** (SSH), **80** (HTTP), **443** (HTTPS) |
| 8️⃣ | `08-setup-fail2ban.sh` | Installs fail2ban to block brute-force SSH login attempts |

Nginx and Supervisor configs are generated from editable templates in [`templates/`](templates), so you can tweak the config shape once without touching the scripts.

🔒 **Note on SSL/HTTPS:** not included here, since a trusted certificate (Let's Encrypt) requires an actual domain pointed at your VM — it can't be issued for a bare IP. If you have a domain, point it at your server and add certbot manually after running `06-setup-nginx.sh` with your domain name.

## ⚙️ How to use

Every script works in **two ways**:

- **Non-interactive** — pass all values as CLI arguments (great for automation)
- **Interactive** — leave arguments out and the script will prompt you for what it needs

Every step also prints out **what it's about to do**, and a **confirmation summary** at the end, so nothing runs silently.

### Run everything at once

```bash
sudo ./setup-all.sh deploy myapp /opt/myapp ./requirements.txt main:app 8000
```

Or just run it with no arguments and answer the prompts:

```bash
sudo ./setup-all.sh
```

### Run a single step

```bash
sudo ./scripts/01-system-update.sh
sudo ./scripts/02-create-user.sh deploy
sudo ./scripts/06-setup-nginx.sh myapp 8000 mydomain.com
```

### Make scripts executable

If you get a "permission denied" error:

```bash
chmod +x setup-all.sh scripts/*.sh
```

## 🖥️ Requirements & Compatibility

- A fresh **Debian-based** VM — built and tested on **Ubuntu 24.04**. Should also work on Debian with no changes.
- **Not compatible as-is** with RHEL/CentOS/Fedora (`dnf`/`yum`) or Arch — these scripts rely on `apt`, `adduser` and `ufw`, which are Debian/Ubuntu-specific.
- Root access (`sudo`)
